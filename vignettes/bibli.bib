@article{Jones2008Senescence,
    abstract = {{Abstract Comparative analyses of survival senescence
                  by using life tables have identified generalizations
                  including the observation that mammals senesce
                  faster than similar-sized birds. These
                  generalizations have been challenged because of
                  limitations of life-table approaches and the growing
                  appreciation that senescence is more than an
                  increasing probability of death. Without using life
                  tables, we examine senescence rates in annual
                  individual fitness using 20 individual-based data
                  sets of terrestrial vertebrates with contrasting
                  life histories and body size. We find that
                  senescence is widespread in the wild and equally
                  likely to occur in survival and
                  reproduction. Additionally, mammals senesce faster
                  than birds because they have a faster life history
                  for a given body size. By allowing us to disentangle
                  the effects of two major fitness components our
                  methods allow an assessment of the robustness of the
                  prevalent life-table approach. Focusing on one
                  aspect of life history – survival or recruitment –
                  can provide reliable information on overall
                  senescence.}},
