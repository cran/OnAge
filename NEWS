* OnAge 1.0-1: First release

* August 28th 2017: created. 'OnAge' implements a likelihood ratio test
of differential onset on senescence. Given two populations with
measured ages and a senescence factor (e.g. body mass), 'OnAge' provides
an asymptotic p-value for the null hypothesis that senescence starts
at the same age in both populations.
